# Heapify

A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

This application provides a visualization of how heaps are constructed and maintained, both as a graph and as an array. This project was built as a way to get a better grasp on the Heap data structure, and I hope it serves someone else similarly.
